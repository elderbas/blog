          <h1><a href="http://prismjs.com/">Prism</a></h1><p>Prism is a lightweight, robust, elegant syntax highlighting library. It&#39;s a spin-off project from <a href="http://dabblet.com/">Dabblet</a>.</p>
<p>You can learn more on <a href="http://prismjs.com/">http://prismjs.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Why another syntax highlighter?: <a href="http://lea.verou.me/2012/07/introducing-prism-an-awesome-new-syntax-highlighter/#more-1841">http://lea.verou.me/2012/07/introducing-prism-an-awesome-new-syntax-highlighter/#more-1841</a></p>
<h2>Contribute to Prism!</h2><p>Prism depends on community contributions to expand and cover a wider array of use cases. If you like it, considering giving back by sending a pull request. Here are a few tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the <a href="http://prismjs.com/extending.html">documentation</a>. Prism was designed to be extensible.</li>
<li>Do not edit <code>prism.js</code>, itâ€™s just the version of Prism used by the Prism website and is built automatically. Limit your changes to the unminified files in the components/ folder. The minified files are also generated automatically.</li>
<li>The build system uses <a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp">gulp</a> to minify the files and build <code>prism.js</code>. Having gulp installed, you just need to run the command <code>gulp</code>.</li>
<li>Please follow the code conventions used in the files already. For example, I use <a href="http://lea.verou.me/2012/01/why-tabs-are-clearly-superior/">tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment</a>. Opening braces are on the same line, closing braces on their own line regardless of construct. There is a space before the opening brace. etc etc.</li>
<li>Please try to err towards more smaller PRs rather than few huge PRs. If a PR includes changes I want to merge and changes I don&#39;t, handling it becomes difficult.</li>
<li>My time is very limited these days, so it might take a long time to review longer PRs (short ones are usually merged very quickly), especially those modifying the Prism Core. This doesn&#39;t mean your PR is rejected.</li>
<li>If you contribute a new language definition, you will be responsible for handling bug reports about that language definition.</li>
<li>If you add a new language definition, theme or plugin, you need to add it to <code>components.js</code> as well, so that it becomes available to the download build page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you so much for contributing!!</p>
